# Advanced Association Rule Mining Techniques for Large-Scale Datasets using Python

This school project presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of advanced association rule mining techniques on two diverse datasets. The implemented techniques include the Apriori algorithm, PCY algorithm, Random Sampling, SON (Savasere, Omiecinski, and Navathe) algorithm, and the multihash version of the PCY algorithm.

The primary objective is to evaluate and compare the performance and effectiveness of these algorithms in uncovering meaningful associations and frequent itemsets within large-scale datasets. To achieve this, we conduct extensive experiments that involve varying dataset sizes, sample percentages (20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100%), and support thresholds (1%, 2%, and 5%).

In addition to measuring runtime efficiency for different datasets, sample percentages, and algorithms, we also assess the quality of discovered associations. For Random Sampling, we specifically analyze the number of false positives, providing insights into its performance in the context of association rule mining.

Here are the results that were discovered during this project:
